# Dynamic Footer (JS + PHP)

## Overview
`dynamic-footer-js-php` is a **smart, dynamic, and responsive footer** for any WordPress website.  
It uses **PHP** and **JavaScript** to automatically handle:  
- Site name detection (from WordPress settings).  
- If no site name is set, it uses the **domain name** (taking the part before the first dot).  
- Multilingual content and automatic text direction (RTL / LTR).  
- Automatic adaptation to **site background and text colors**.  
- Fully **responsive design** with elegant link hover effects.
